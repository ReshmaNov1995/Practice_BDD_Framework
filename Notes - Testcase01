Intro: Behavioural driven development. Agile s/w development technique. 
Developer, QA, Non-Technical Guy(Business Analyst) will involve in the process. BDD is said to be Behave in python.
It will work based on feature directories(involves step definition and feature file).

Sponsor(Client) /BA will give the scenario to develop. Based on this scenario, we will write in a Gherkin language keyword.
Gherkin language is easy to understand that's why it is a advantage of BDD.

Feature file - Create directory in the name of steps and create the file inside it with the extension of .feature.
Step Definition - It is written in Python file.

Feature file - It has 6 section. Both feature file and step file should be inside the step folder.
Inside the feature file,

Feature:feature name
Scenario:short description
Given:condition (chrome la launch aganum)
When:oru event(login pandrom)
And:UN
And:password
Then:when oda output(home page varanum)
And:validate the title name

Note: "And" is used for continuation of "When" and "Then". While using in python file it has to be used as Then and When only.
To run the file, behave filename.feature --no-capture
--no-capture -> This will show the print statement in console.
Feature file has to be run in BDD framework. It will call the step definition file by default.
Print statement will be displayed automatically if the Testcase has failed.

behave -v --no-capture -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o 
"Procedure_end_end/BDD/Background/steps/Advance_background/steps/reports/" 
Procedure_end_end/BDD/Background/steps/Advance_background/steps/background.feature
Note: (verbose - small info, format - Json file will be formatted, output - Report creation path, feature file's path(Relative path is enough))

While writing the method "context" has to be written inside the method.
